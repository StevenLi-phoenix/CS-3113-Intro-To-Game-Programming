# Requirements

### Requirement 1: At Least Three Objects (25%)

* At least three different "objects" in the scene.
* Each object must use a different texture.
* Textures must not be solid colors, but actual images.
* You may use any images you like that were not used in class.

---

### Requirement 2: Relative Position (10%)

* At least one object must transform in relation to another object.

---

### Requirement 3: Movement (65%)

* Every object must translate in a pattern **other than** just up/down or left/right.
* Each object must translate in a slightly different pattern.
* You may use orbiting (from the first classwork project) as one pattern.
* At least one object must rotate.
* At least one object must scale.

---

## Common Issues

* Be careful with movement patterns and transformations.

---

## Extra Credit

* Have the game’s background color also change in some kind of pattern.
